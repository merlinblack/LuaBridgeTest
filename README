A bunch of small concept programs to trial various things
with luabridge.

autodowncast:
Not as 'automatic' as LuaBind, however lets you test if a
class is actually a derived class and cast it downwards.

calling:
No rocket science here. Just sanity checking calling a Lua
function via LuaRef.

enumtable:
Store constants somewhere handy...

guiexample:
How a GUI routing system might be done.

luamemberoveride:
Using a LuaRef to override a C++ member with a Lua one.

introspection:
A function that returns a table of class methods, and
members bound.
